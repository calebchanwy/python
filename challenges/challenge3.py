# It has been a busy year at mountain warehouse, having made lots of sales.

# For this challenge you will be given an array of sales broken down by Branch and Date.
# You will need to sum all branch across multiple days and identify which branch had the highest sales overall
# Assume that there is only one branch with the highest total
# We have provided some starting code but if you know of a better method then go ahead with that
